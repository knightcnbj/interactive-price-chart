1. app.js fetches historical data from the CoinDesk API and formats it into an array of objects.
2. Data is passed to the LineChart.js component which renders the chart based on the data supplied from app.js.
3. When the SVG component rendered in LineChart.js is hovered on, 3 things happen: LineChart.js draws a vertical line on the cursor coordinates. It determines the closest data point to the cursor and draws a circle to highlight that data point. Finally, data is passed back to app.js indicating the hover location, and closest point.
4. app.js sends data to ToolTip.js so the tool tip can render in the correct location, and with the correct data.
5. InfoBox.js runs independently of the other components and fetches real time data from the CoinDesk API every 90 seconds. The data is formatted and then displayed to the user.
